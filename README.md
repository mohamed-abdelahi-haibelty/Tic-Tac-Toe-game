# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe


This project is an intermediate [Front End Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v) that involves creating
a Tic Tac Toe game. The game allows the user to choose whether to play against another player or against the CPU, which is implemented with the minmax algorithm,
making it unbeatable. The user can also choose which player goes first, X or O


## Demo
You can try out the game live by visiting this link: https://unbeatble-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app/


## How to play

 1. Choose the game mode, player vs player or player vs CPU.
 2. If playing against the CPU, choose which player goes first, X or O.
 3. Click on a cell to place your mark.
 4. The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the board is full.
 5. If playing against the CPU, try your best to not lose!
